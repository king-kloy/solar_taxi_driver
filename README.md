# solar_taxi_driver

The Solar Taxi Driver App was built to help the drivers who will be working at the Solar Taxi company use it to pick up passengers and others who want to use their service. It was one of the projects I worked on when I was interning at Kumasi Hive on June 3, 2019 to July 26, 2019.

I was built using:
